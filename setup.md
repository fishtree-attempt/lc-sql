## Software Requirements


### DB Browser for SQLite

You  will need to install [DB Browser for SQLite](http://sqlitebrowser.org) to complete these lessons. DB Browser for SQLite provides a graphical user interface for connecting to and interacting with a SQLLite database. This application bundles SQLite, so you won't need to install SQLite separately.

Note: on Windows, the PortableApp download is recommended as the regular version may take a long time to complete on certain systems.

### SQLite


This step is optional. If you are completing the tutorial with DB Browser for SQLite, you won't need to install SQLite separately. If you would like to run SQLite commands directly on the command line, you may need to install [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) separately. 

#### Linux and Mac OS x

SQLite command line tools come preinstalled on Linux and Mac OS x.

In order to check they are available type `sqlite3` at the terminal command line. To exit type `.exit`.

#### Windows

On Windows download the [Windows Installer](https://github.com/swcarpentry/windows-installer/releases/download/v0.3/SWCarpentryInstaller.exe)
Copy the file to a directory and open the directory using the windows command line. Type `sqlite3`.

For a more detailed explanation see this [tutorial](http://www.sqlitetutorial.net/download-install-sqlite/).
